    <h1>CODING CAREERS</h1>

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p><b>Coding is how we tell computers, apps, and games what to do! People who learn to code can build amazing
                things like websites, video games, and apps.</b></p>
        <p>Let's explore some fun and exciting careers that use <u>coding</u> every day.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- First career box -->
    <div class="career">
        <h2><i>1. Web Developer</i></h2> <!-- Using inline CSS for italics -->
        <img src="https://free-vectors.net/_ph/10/737099466.jpg" alt="Web Developer">
        <p>Web developers build websites that people use every day! They write code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to
            make web pages look nice, colorful, and easy to use. Web developers make sure everything works properly,
            like buttons, menus, and images. They can design anything from simple pages to big websites with lots of
            pages and features.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b> A school’s website where students can see their timetable, read news, or find homework help.
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Second career box -->
    <div class="career">
        <h2><i>2. Game Developer</i></h2>
        <img src="https://img.goodfon.com/original/1920x1080/7/3f/x-box-gamepad-minimalizm.jpg" alt="Game Developer">
        <p>Game developers use code to create fun and exciting video games! They plan the game’s levels, design
            characters, and make rules about how the game works. They also add sound, colors, and effects to make it
            more fun. Game developers need to think creatively and solve problems so the game runs smoothly and players
            enjoy it.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b> A racing game where players drive cars and try to win trophies!</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Third career box -->
    <div class="career">
        <h2><i>3. App Developer</i></h2>
        <img src="https://storage.needpix.com/rsynced_images/developer-4027334_1280.png" alt="App Developer">
        <p>App developers create apps that people use on phones and tablets. These apps can help you learn, play, shop,
            or chat with friends. App developers design how the app looks and make sure it responds when someone taps or
            swipes the screen. They use different programming languages and tools to build apps that are fast, fun, and
            useful.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b> A math game that helps kids practice adding and subtracting while earning stars!</p>
