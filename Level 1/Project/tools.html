    <div class="intro">
        <p>These are some fun resources that help kids like me to learn coding.
            They make learning a lot more <b>easy and exciting!</b>
        </p>
    </div>

    <!-- First Coding Tool -->
    <!-- This box holds the image and the text side-by-side -->
    <div class="tool-box">
        <!-- Tool Picture -->
        <img scr="https://cdn.worldvectorlogo.com/logos/visual-studio-code-1.svg" 
            alt="Visual Studio Code Logo">

        <!-- This box shows the description next to the picture -->
        <div class = "tool-text">
            <h2><i>Visual Studio Code</i></h2>
            <p>This is a super cool program I use to write real code. 
                It looks like a notebook but for typing code!</p>
            <p>I used it to make a website with HTML and CSS (yes, <i>this</i> website). 
                It helps me fix mistakes easily too, especially since this is all new to me.</p>
            <p><b>Why I like it:</b> It feels like I’m a real coder and it has colorful words!</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Second Coding Tool -->
    <div class="tool-box">
        <img src="https://www.bram.us/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/css-diner.png" alt="CSS Diner">
        <div class="tool-text">
            <h2>CSS Diner</h2>
            <p>CSS Diner is a fun game that teaches us how to pick the right parts of a webpage to style using CSS.
                We play by choosing the right “plates” on the table!</p>
            <p><b>Why kids love it:</b> It feels like a yummy food game that helps you learn how to make websites look nice.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Third Coding Tool -->
    <div class="tool-box">
        <img src="https://fullsteam.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/ScratchLogo-300x300.png" alt="Scratch">
        <div class="tool-text">
            <h2>Scratch</h2>
            <p>Scratch is a colorful coding tool where we can drag and snap blocks to make our own games and stories. 
                We don’t need to actually type code, it is just about putting pieces together to create your own story.
                It's like playing with building blocks!</p>
            <p><b>Why it’s fun:</b> We can create personal animations and games, and share them with friends. It feels like magic when the characters start moving!</p>
